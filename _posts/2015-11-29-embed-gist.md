One of the things I’ve been meaning to do was to figure out how to embed code from GitHub onto a blog. Not only is this awesome, but would enhance our ability to disseminate knowledge.

After a quick Google search, I stumbled onto Robert Greiner’s [Using Github as a Syntax Highlighter for Your Blog or Website](http://robertgreiner.com/2012/04/using-github-as-a-syntax-highlighter/). There he explains in detail how it’s done ... but here is the TL;DR version:

1. Have gist
2. Embed gist

<script src="https://gist.github.com/robertgreiner/2479301.js"></script>

… and that’s about it. Simple.
