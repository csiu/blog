excerpt: Using bookdown
---

Today is going to be simple.

I want to generate an eBook for documenting knowledge in a aesthetically pleasing and readable format.

The R Markdown for this little project is found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csiu/100daysofcode/master/misc/day84.Rmd).

## What is Bookdown?

*Source: [https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)*

- is a package built on top of [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)
- inherits the simplicity of the Markdown syntax
- has added features like multi-page HTML output, numbering and cross-referencing figures/tables/sections/equations, and inserting parts/appendices
- imports the [GitBook style](https://www.gitbook.com) to create elegant and appealing HTML book pages
- you can see additional examples at [https://bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org).

## Using bookdown

1. `install.packages("bookdown")`
2. Define header to be `documentclass: book`

```
---
title: "A Book"
author: "csiu"
site: bookdown::bookdown_site
documentclass: book
output:
  bookdown::gitbook: default
  bookdown::pdf_book: default
---
```

Once the header is defined, the rest of the script needs to be defined.

- A section (`#`) refers to a chapter in the book
- A subsection (`##`) refers to a section in the chapter of the book
