Today I’ve attended a meetup where I’ve heard two fascinating talks.

> PyData Vancouver Meetup:\\
> [Algorithmic Trading, Machine Learning - Cool things with PyData](https://www.meetup.com/vanpydata/events/237644944/)\\

### Algorithmic Trading with Quantopian
- [<i class="fa fa-twitter"></i>](https://twitter.com/theSPYsurfer) **Speaker:** François Lucas, founder of the [SPY Surfer](http://thespysurfer.com)
- **tl;dr:** Making data-driven investing decisions

His slides can be found [here](http://thespysurfer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/PyDataApril4.pdf).

From what I understood, the first speaker uses data mining to obtain Yahoo S&P500 financial data to make monthly investment decisions based on the following algorithm:

```
Algo:
- At the End of the Month:
  - If price > 10-month SMA, go long
  - Else Bonds
- Do nothing in between
```

- *"SMA" stands for <s>Separately managed account e.g. S&P 500</s> simple moving average*
- *"10-month SMA" refers to the average running price over the past 10 month*
- *["long"](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp) refers to buying of a e.g. stock with the expectation it will rise in vlaue*
- *"Else Bonds" means buy bonds if the price is below the 10 month SMA average*

He compares his algorithm to Warren Buffett’s exchange-traded fund (ETF) and shows that on a logged scale (which accounts for value differences due to compounding) that the two trading strategies are comparable.

### Learning From Implicit Data
- [<i class="fa fa-twitter"></i>](https://twitter.com/benfrederickson) **Speaker:** Ben Frederickson, Vancouver Data Products team lead at Flipboard
- **tl;dr:** Finding similar music using Matrix Factorization

Ben's talk is essentially described by the following posts:

- #1. [Distance Metrics for Fun and Profit](http://www.benfrederickson.com/distance-metrics/)
- #2. [Faster Implicit Matrix Factorization](http://www.benfrederickson.com/matrix-factorization/)
- #3. [Finding Similar Music with Matrix Factorization](http://www.benfrederickson.com/fast-implicit-matrix-factorization/)

From what I understood, he describes the use of a BM25 distance metric (in comparison with cosine similarity and TFIDF) in post #1. He goes into matrix factorization (dividing a big matrix into smaller, condensed, and presumably generalized matrices) in post #2. He finds "The Arcade Fire" is a highly ranked similar hit to "Arcade Fire", which is amazing because users often mention one without the other. Finally he touched upon a faster implementation that what was demoed in post #3.

At the end of the talk, Ben points to the following resources:
