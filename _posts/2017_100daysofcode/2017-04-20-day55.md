Continuing from where I left off a couple days of ago on [Day 53]({{ site.baseurl }}/update/2017/04/18/day53.html), I now have the $$U$$, $$\Sigma$$, and $$V$$ matrices. I now can now investigate the following question: *given a document, what is the most similar document to it in the corpus*.

- $$U$$ - document space
- $$\Sigma$$ - interaction between documents and words
- $$V$$ - words space

The Jupyter Notebook for this little project is found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/csiu/kick/blob/master/src/ipynb/day55_minimizing_document_distance.ipynb). I also created a shell script to start and stop my PostgreSQL server [here](https://github.com/csiu/kick/blob/bf2fd573f9eae78a2f30ce9f6214f5571c601699/src/sh/control_postgres.sh).

### Computing distances

In text analysis, distance is generally measured by Euclidean or Cosine distances. (In this post, I used the Euclidean distance.)

> **Euclidean distance** = $$\sqrt{\Sigma^n_{i=1}{(q_i - p_i)^2}}$$\\
> where $$q$$ and $$p$$ are 2 points; and $$n$$ is the number of dimensions.


To find the closest document, we look in the document space i.e. $$U$$. For the pairwise comparison of all documents to all documents, my computer crashed. Best not to try that again.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import pairwise_distances

# dist = pairwise_distances(U, U, metric='euclidean')
# dist = pairwise_distances(U, U, metric='cosine')
```

As a work around, we can -- for a given document ("document0") -- calculate the distance between this document with every other document. *Compute distance: 1 to many -- yes; many to many -- no.*

```python
# Look at first document
dist = pairwise_distances(np.asmatrix(U[0]), U, metric='euclidean')
```

Here we plot the distribution of distances to document0:

### Ranking by document similarity

To find the documents most similar to document0, we sort by increasing distances and arbitrarily display the top 5 documents most similar to document0. The closest document is of course itself (sanity check passed).

```python
# Sort by distance
top_5 = df_dist.sort_values("distance").head()
```

<div>
<table border="0" class="dataframe" align="center">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>distance</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>6.585445e-10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>131582</th>
      <td>1.690946e-02</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>131258</th>
      <td>1.705223e-02</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>129792</th>
      <td>1.722522e-02</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>159369</th>
      <td>1.842629e-02</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Mapping from indexes to Kickstarter projects

The indexes of the above matrices match the Kickstarter project files that were previously created in [Day 50]({{ site.baseurl }}/update/2017/04/15/day50.html). After loading the original and preprocessed Kickstarter project data, we can then use the indexes to obtain the similar projects.

```python
for index, row in df.iloc[top_5.index].iterrows():
    original_text = df_original[df_original['id'] == row['id']].iloc[0]['document']

    print('>> %s | %s' % (row['id'], row['document']),
          original_text, "\n", sep="\n")
```
