excerpt: When do I drink?
---

I passed! And so, to do something different, I decided to visualize data in D3. The product of this project is found at [bl.ocks.org/csiu](https://bl.ocks.org/csiu/33a8cd7d152b06eeca95f2556bc0eafb).

### 25 drinks and counting

One of the things that I keep track of is the number of drinks I had. Near the start of my thesis, I remember someone mentioning that it's hard to find someone (outside personal/cultural/religious reasons) who did not have more than 10 drinks. At that point I was at less than 10, but now I'm at 25.

*What happened?*

### Calendars in D3

After referring to my list of drinks, calendar of events, and trip down memory lane, I compiled a list of dates and drinks. Since this is time series data, I decided to visualize this as one would in a calendar.

Looking online, I based my code on the following examples:

1. [bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063318](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063318) for the foundation of the code
2. [bl.ocks.org/eesur/5fbda7f410d31da35e42](http://bl.ocks.org/eesur/5fbda7f410d31da35e42) for adding in the months of the year and days of the week

### More references

In producing the visualization, I went through the code line by line to try and understand what was being done. In the code at [bl.ocks.org/csiu](https://bl.ocks.org/csiu/33a8cd7d152b06eeca95f2556bc0eafb), I made comments on what each chunk does.

A couple of references I thought were useful are:
