## Smelly London Project

Data/text mining of Medical Office Health (MOH) records of smells to interpret the health of 19th and 20th century Londoners

> "[Smelly London: visualising historical smells through text-mining, geo-referencing and mapping](https://csvconf.com/speakers/#deborah-leem)" -- Deborah Leem\\

- [www.londonsmells.co.uk](www.londonsmells.co.uk) (project page)
- Produced dataset of smell-related words
  - From 19th and 20th century London
  - records written by the Medical Office of Health
- Created smell categories
  - Used smell ontology/dictionary for categorization
- Implied smells and diseases
  - There is correlation of smells and diseases
  - Future work to use machine learning to get the implied smells
- Visualization of smells on the map of London

## Designing data exploration

Design by exploring the data and then producing high level analyses (after asking a few key questions).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Slides to go with my <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/csvconf?src=hash">#csvconf</a> talk: <a href="https://t.co/T2Sybf2g20">https://t.co/T2Sybf2g20</a></p>&mdash; Simon Jockers (@sjockers) <a href="https://twitter.com/sjockers/status/859481246941847552">May 2, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

- People are sitting on large datasets and there is a need for computer assisted reporting
  - See German National Archive (Heimatkunde) for an instance of publishing a dataset instead of a story
- [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org) is journalism in the public interest
- Start by exploring the data (use statistical packages, browse, & look at the data from different methods) and then produce high level analysis of the data
- Build tools (not graphics)
- Things to consider:
  - **What is the data?** Tables? Graphs? Documents/text?
  - **Should this really be public?** Is it in the public's interest? Contain sensitive information? Will there be problems that may arise?
  - **Who are the users?** What are their goals (interest in the topic)? Data literacy? Media consumption habits (eg. casual & on the go with lower attention; or high attention in office setting)?
  - **How** should the data be displayed? Macro far view (to get the big picture/high-level overviews) or Micro near view (to look at individual data points; anecdotes or stories)
  - **Personalization**
  - **Embedding** by integrating visualization with narrative
  - How to publish data & make it interesting?

## Better Bar graphics

Data visualization has been used in different ways and can influence how the data is perceived by changing aesthetics.

> [Daniel Orbach
The Journey to a better bar graph, and beyond](https://csvconf.com/speakers/#daniel-orbach) -- Daniel Orbach\\

- Small decisions make large visual impact
- Visualization as **documentation**
  - Christopher Scheiner 1630 AD (document sun spots)
  - using "small multiples"
- Visualization as **an opinion to express an argument**
  - William Playfair 1822 AD (price of wheat)
- Visualization for **answers from big data**
  - John Snow 1855 AD (source of cholera is from single infected water hole)
- Data visualization evolves alongside information, complexity, and technology
- By changing the shape, colour, & rhythms of a data visualization, the visualization influences how the data is perceived
- Data visualization is only going to get harder
  - eg. Dataviz, meet machine learning (such as the TensorBoard)
- Seeing critically is about seeing what is there and what is not there
- Questions to ask when designing/consuming data visualizations
  - **Should this be visualized?**
      - Less than 20 points, maybe use a table
      - Way too complicated (too many variables & you don't know what you are trying to show)
  - **What assumptions am I making?**
      - To some people, red=bad and green=good; maybe use neutral colours such as yellow and blue instead
  - **What am I trying to depict?**
      - Among items, over time, distribution, comparisons
- Orbach uses **Logger** to document train rides
- Orbach suggested to use **Sketch** as adobe editor

## **Keynote |** U.S. Open Data Policy

Advocating for open data

> Heather Joseph\\
<a href="https://twitter.com/hjoseph" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false">Follow @hjoseph</a><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

- SPARC \| [www.sparcopen.org](https://sparcopen.org) (organization, whose goal is to make open the default in research and education)
- There are a number of U.S. Information Policy Precedents, including OMB Circular A-130, "Management of Federal information resources." (1996)
- The "Open Government Directive"
  - Set expectations from day 1 of the Obama administration
  - This directive is to make information available in open format
  - see WayBack Machine (internet archive) of data.gov
- We need talent & visibility in leadership roles
  - DJ Patil (the first US chief data scientist)
  - DATA Act for Digital Accountability and Transparency
- Now we have to work through: Fake news, alternative facts, 404 errors (from pages being removed from websites), & gag orders
- What we can do
  1. Play active, pragmatic defence
    - Data rescue events/ DataRefuge
  2. Recognize that progress is still possible
  3. Preserving data services active
    - We have to understand what the new priorities are for this administration and that open transport is out
- American Taxpayers are entitled to the Research they
pay for
- Position open data as an enabling force
  - eg. Making financial report data open and machine readable to make it easier for potential investors to create jobs
- "pdf is not searchable format"
- Individuals make a difference
  - **Speak out, step up, take action**

## Data and abuse of power

Types of data biases

> [Data & Abuse of Power](https://csvconf.com/speakers/#moiz-syed) -- Moiz Syed\\
> <a href="https://twitter.com/MoizSyed" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false">Follow @MoizSyed</a><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

- Trial and terror: The intercept
- Telling a false/biased story
- Spotting fake news
- Bias:
  - We don't collect it e.g. police shooting data
  - We don't collect it and you can't either (eg. cut funding for gun violence; NFL brain injury and mental disabilities)
  - We collect it but you can't have it (eg. remove open Whitehouse data)
  - We frame what we share
      - how data is being aggregated
      - how the data is sampled
      - how the data is labeled
  - The data is the bias

## Scratching Someone Else's Itch

An itch is a problem and a scratch is the process of solving the problem.

> [Scratching Someone Else's Itch](https://csvconf.com/speakers/#adam-hyde) -- Adam Hyde\\

- [adamhyde.net](https://www.adamhyde.net) (personal website)
- Coko \| [https://coko.foundation](https://coko.foundation) for solving scholarly publishing problems with open source
- Open-source is good for infrastructure, developer tools, but not for user-facing solutions
- Why has open source fail?
    - Open source is not good at solving someone's Itch
    - the developer is the code specialist; but the user is the use case specialist
- **Design First & Design with the User** by sitting down with the user
- The Cabbage Tree methods \| [https://www.cabbagetree.org](https://www.cabbagetree.org)
    - Good for: Building platforms, working with organizations, fixing workflows
    - Facilitated Design
    - Use case specialist to design their own products
    - Iterative Design -> Build Sessions
- Example: [Editoria](https://editoria.pub)

## Misleading people with data

Analyses and visualizations of raw data can be misleading.

- Smaller schools do better on exams
  - Looking at the standard deviation of the mean, higher variability are in smaller schools
  - called the most "dangerous equation" by Howard Weiner
  -  possible solutions: standardize variables by subtracting overall mean and dividing by stdev_x to make them comparable
- Simpson's paradox: Gender Discrimination at UC Berkeley?
  - If split by department -> gender is roughly equal
  - If aggregate by all, more males than females admitted
- Praise or Rebuke?
  - Praise if score >5; but students tend to do worst in next time
  - Rebuke if score <4; but students tend to do better next time
  - Regression to the mean
      - If mean is 5, then by random chance score will be better/worst
- Evolutionary Psychology: Work from Satoshi Kanazawa
  - "Beautiful parents have more daughters (...)"
      - Study rated people's attractiveness (Score 5 for very attractive)
      - Type 1 error (false positive)
      - Why compare group 5 to the rest?
      - Should be using multiple test correction
  - "Engineers have more sons, nurses have more daughters"
  - "Why you can't get a date on a Saturday night and why most suicide bombers are muslim"

  > To draw the rabbit out of the hat you always have to always have to have put it in beforehand -Jacques Lacan

- Advice:
  - Be careful of observational studies
  - Things should be reproducible
  - Use randomized controlled experiments
  - Talk to subject experts

- Corporate vs Indie Data science
  - Corporate -- it's not personal, it's business; you are working for the man
- "Data is useless without context" [@thegrugq](https://twitter.com/thegrugq) (security engineer)
  - Context is everything
  - Once you see the cow, you can't unsee it
- Agenda
  - Data Science in Industry
  - Building effective data science teams
  - Proper care and maintenance of data teams

**Data Science in Industry**

- Somethings don't change:
  - data collection, wrangle, deploy, edit, modify, analyze, bugfix, ...
  - Understand, Collection, Explore/Viz, Clear/Transform, Model, Validate, Communicate/Deploy
- Bespoke solutions <-> introduction of production software
- Some things change quite a bit
- Blended objectives
  - Novel R&D - secret stuff
  - Legacy Production - money maker
  - Production stuff should never fail
  - When working on production scale, you should not break it
  - Legacy projects, could be pushed into production (with continuous validation) and can turn to novel stuff

**Building effective data science teams**

- Drew Conway ([@drewconway](https://twitter.com/drewconway)): Data Science 3-way venn diagram with Hacking + Math/Stats + Substantive Expert
  - aka Unicorn ... but Unicorns do not exist
  - "Your intuition will only be accurate if your cumulative experience is a representative sample of reality" [@adampiore](https://twitter.com/adampiore)
  - There are different beasts (horse, llama, zebras, ...) that offer different gifts
- Super Chickens (from xkcd): are the most egg laying chicken. When you put them together, in 6 generations, they kill each other
  - Dynasties and intellectual inbreeding
  - Should not build a team of "super chickens" -- every single player should bring something different
  - Mirror-tocracies (Kara Swisher) & Survivorship Bias
- Building a large reality
  - Hire for what the team needs (What are the gaps? Lack of overlaps?)
  - Imposter Syndrome:

- There's more than one way to skin a cat
  - Psychological safety and lower anxiety
  - Mistakes might have been made
- Common Blind Spots:
  - Software engineers - sampling
  - Deep learnings - rigorous statistics (typically DL are from computer science background; they lack rigorous analyses such as math & topology)
  - PhDs - ship-it-ness (because you care for truth; for magic to take place ... the product has to leave the bench, have to be marketed)
  - Statistician - Unit tests (by the logic of this equation it's obvious -- why need unit tests?)
  - Managers - P-hacking (managers keep the team running, but to make money, the answer needs to be this)
- Multiple-Objective Decision Analysis (perspectives, seniority, backgrounds, languages, disciplines)
- How to interview for best intersections:
  - How self aware of you? What did you learn? Can you tell of me about it?
  - Test communication skills

**Proper care and maintenance of data teams**

- Data Team responsibilities:
  - Data Quality, Collection, Engineering, Security, Ethics, Communication, ROI
- "Any sufficiently advanced negligence is indistinguishable from malice." Deb Chachra ([@debcha](https://twitter.com/debcha))
  - It's not that no one cares, it's that non-data folks unprepared to care
  - Not enough information
  - When should you start caring? Do it now
- What you expect is different the current state of things
  - what exists is a system optimized for ... not-analysis
  - But this is good, because the company has been optimized for something else
- It is really easy to care, by leaving breadcrumbs
  - Documentation is how you "program" a business
    - Motivation
    - Reason to believe hypothesis
    - Dead ends
    - Pause projects
    - ...
- Figure out "What does the business do? Really?"
  - MacDonald is a real estate company
- Having Junior Team Members is a great forcing function!
  - They are not jaded, and willing to ask senior members won't ask

**Q&A**

- Different company have different ways to value data assets
- Documentation is to business is code is to product
  - Documentation is not yet generalizable
  - Atlassian Confluence, though mediocre solution, provides centralized indexing + Plugins
