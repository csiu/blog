*Today is the first day of the [CSV Conference](https://csvconf.com) in Portland and the following are notes I’ve taken regarding the talks I’ve attended.*

### Smelly London Porject

D. Leem | @1202DL

- Data/text mining from MOH health records & smells to interpret the health of londoner
- Produced dataset of smell-related words
  - From 19th and 20th London
  - written by the Medical Office of Health
- Created smell categories
  - Use smell ontology/dictionary
- Implied smells and diseases
  - correlation of smells and diseases
  - machine learning to get implied smells
- Visualization/Maps of London

### Designing data exploration

S. Jockers | @sjockers | sjockers.github.io/slides/csvconf17

- Sitting on large datasets/Use computer assisted reporting
- Want to publish data (not stories)
  - See German national archive
- ProPublica
- Start by exploring the data (by using statistical packages, browsing, looking at data from different methods) and then produce high level analysis of the data
- Build tools (not graphics)
- What is the data?
  - Tables, Graphs, Documents/text
- Should this really be public?
  - Public interest? Sensitive information? Problems that may arise?
- Who are the users?
  - Goals (interest in the topic)
  - Data literacy
  - Media consumption habits (casual on the go, lower attention; high attention in office)
- How?
  - Macro: far view (big picture, high-level overviews)
  - Micro: near view (individual data points; anecdotes or stories)
- Personalization
- Embedding
  - intergrating visualization with narrative
- How to publish data & make it interesting

### Better Bar graphics

D. Orbach | @orbachdl

- Small decision -> large visual impact
- visualization as documentation
  - Christopher Scheiner 1630AD (using small multiples)
- visualization as an opinion to express an argument
  - William Playfair 1822AD
- visualization for answers from big data
  - John snow 1855AD for visualizing collera through infected water hole
- data visualization evolves alongside information, complexity, and technology
- Visualize influence
  - By changing shape & colour, rhythms to influence how perceive data
- It's only going to get harder
  - Dataviz, meet machine learning (eg TensorBoard)
- Seeing critically is about seeing what is there and what is not there
- Questions to ask when designing/consuming data visualizations
  - Should this be visualized?
      - Less than 20 points, use table
      - Way too complicated (too many variables, don't  know what you are trying to show)
  - What assumptions am I making?
      - Use neutral colours
  - What am I trying to depict?
      - Among items, over time, distribution, comparisons
- **logger** to document train rides
- **sketch** adobe editor

### **Keynote** US Open Data Policy: The STate of Playfair

H. Joseph | www.sparcopen.org

- Advocating for open data
- SPARC's goal is to make open the default in research and education
- OMB Circular A-130
- Open Government Directive
  - Set expectation from day 1 of Obama administration
  - Make information available in open format
- see way back machine: Data.gov
- We need talent & visibility in leadership role
  - eg DJ Patil as first data scientist
- Data act
- Had to work through: Fake news, alternative facts, 404 errors (things being removed from websites), gag orders
1. Play active, pragmatic defence
  - Data rescue events/ DataRefuge
2. Recognize that progress is still possible & position ourselves to drives.
3. Preserving data services active
We have to understand what the new priorities are for this administration and open transport is out
- American Taxpayers are Entitled to the Research they
pay for.
- Position open data as am enabling
- Make financial reporting data open and machine readable in order to ... make it easier for potential investing to create job.
- Building strong(er) cross-sector relationships to leverrage these kinds of success.
- "pdf is not searchable format"
Understand that publicly-funded isn't the only game in tk

- Open data to save crucial roles as exemplar [pressure up]]
- individuals make a difference
  - Speak out, step up, take action

### Data and the abuse and power

- Trial and terror: The intercept
- Telling a false/biased story
- How to spot fake news
- Bias:
  - We don't collect it e.g. police shooting data
  - We don't collect it and you can't either (eg. cut funding for gun violence; NFL brain injury)
  - We collect it but you can't have it (eg. remove open whitehouse data)
  - We frame what we share
      - how data is being aggregated
      - how the data is sampled
      - how the data is labeled
  - The data is the bias

### Scratching Someone Else's Itch

A. Hyde | adamhyde.net

- Producing open source products
- Coko | https://coko.foundation for solving scholarly publishing problems with open source
- Itch = problem; Scratch = process of solving the problem
- Developer = use-case & code specialist
- Open-source - solves the infrastructure & developer tools problems but not the user-facing solutions
- Why has open source fail?
    - Open source is not good at solving someone's Itch
    - the developer is the code specialist; the user is the use case specialist
- Design First & Design with the User
    - Sit down with the user
- The Cabbage Tree methods | https://www.cabbagetree.org
    - good for: Building platforms, working with organizations, fixing workflows
    - Facilitated Design
    - Use case specialist to design their own products
    - Iterative Design -> Building
- Editoria

### Misleading people with data

P. Burckhardt

- Smaller schools do better on exams
  - Standard Deviation of the mean
  - higher variability = smaller schools
  - called the most "dangerous equation" by Howard Weiner
  -  possible solutions: standardize variables by subtracting overall mean and dividing by stdev_x to make them comparable
- Simpson's paradox: Gender Discrimination at UC Berkeley?
  - If split by department -> gender roughly equally
  - If aggregate by all, more males
- Praise or Rebuke?
  - Praise >5 -> do worst in next time
  - Rebuke <4 -> do better next time
  - Regression to the mean
      - If mean is 5, then random chance do better or worst
- Evolutionary Psychology: Work from Satoshi Kanazawa
  - "Beautiful parents have more daughters (...)"
      - Study rated people's attractiveness (Score 5 for very attractive)
      - Type 1 error
      - Why compare group 5 to the rest?
      - You should use multiple test correction
  - "Engineers have more sons, nurses have more daughters"
  - "Why you can't get a date on a Saturday night and why most suicide bombers are muslim"


  > To draw the rabbit out of the hat you always have to always have to have put it in beforehand -Jacques

- Advice:
  - Be careful of observational studies
  - Things should be reproducible
  - Use randomized controlled experiments
  - Talk to subject experts


### Continuous Data Validation for everyone

A. Mercader | @amercader

- ckan
- open knowledge
- Frictionless data package: standards & tooling
  - measurable improvement in how data is shared/consumed/analyzed
- Tabular Data Package
  - Data Package + Table Schema + CSV (datapackage.json + CSV)
- Validate tabular table by
  - structure (eg. are there duplicate row? missing headers?)
  - comparing the data file against schema (eg is this field an int?)
- **goodtables.io** to bring continuous to everyone
  - Becomes a github check
  - goodtables.yml to define source, schema, delimiter, skip_rows

### Corporate Data Science

A. Bassa | @angebassa

- Building successful data science teams
- Corporate vs Indie Data science
  - Corporate -- it's not personal, it's business; you are working for the man
- "Data is useless without context" @thegrugq (security engineer)
  - Context is everything
  - Once you see the cow, you can't unsee it
- Agenda
  - Data Science in Industry
  - Building effective data science teams
  - Proper care and maintenance of data teams

**Data Science in Industry**

- Somethings don't change: data collection, wrangle, deploy, edit, modify, analyze, bugfix, ...
  - Understand, Collection, Explore/Viz, Clear/Transform, Model, Validate, Communicate/Deploy
- The introduction of production software
  - bespoke solutions
- Some things change quite a bit
- Blended objectives
  - Novel R&D - secret stuff
  - Legacy Production - money maker
  - Production stuff should never fail
  - When working on production scale, you should not break it
  - Legacy projects, you could push into production (continuous validation) ... can turn to novel stuff

**Building effective data science teams**

- Drew Conway: Data Science 3-way venn diagram with Hacking + Math/Stats + Substantive Expert
  - aka Unicorn ... but Unicorns do not exist
  - "Your intuition will only be accurate if your cumulative experience is a representative sample of reality" @adampiore
  - There are different beasts (horse, lamma) that offer different gifts
- Super Chickens (xkcd): select most laying chicken; put them together; 6 generations, they kill each other
  - Dynasties and intellectual inbreeding
  - Should not build a team of "super chickens" -- every single player should bring something different
  - Mirror-tocracies (Kara Swisher) & Survivorship Bias
  - Building a large reality | Imposter Syndrome (David Whitaker?)
  - Hire for what the team need (What are the gaps? Lack of overlaps?)
- There's More than one way to skin a cat
  - Psychological safety and lower anxiety
  - Mistakes Might have been made
- Common Blind Spots:
  - Software engineers - sampling
  - Deep learnings - rigorous statistics (from computer science bend; lack of rigorous analysis such as math & topology)
  - PhDs - ship-it-ness because you care for truth; for magic to take place ... product have to leave the bench, have to be marketed
  - Statistician - Unit tests (logic of this equation it's obvious)
  - Managers - P-hacking (keep team running so can make money; the answer needs to be this)
- Multiple-Objective Decision Analysis (perspectives, seniority, backgrounds, languages, disciplines)
- How to interview for best intersections:
  - How self aware of you? What did you learn? Can you tell of me about it?
  - Test communication

**Proper care and maintenance of data teams**

- Data Team responsibilities:
  - Data Quality, Collection, Engineering, Security, Ethics, Communication, ROI
- "Any sufficiently advanced negligence is indistinguishable from malice." Deb Chachra
- It's not that no one cares, it's that non-data folks unprepared to care
  - Not enough information
- When should you start caring? Do it now
- What you expect is different the current state of things (what exists is a system optimized for ... not-analysis)
  - But this is good, because the company has been optimized for something else
- It is really easy to care, by leaving breadcrumbs
  - Documentation is how you "program" a business
    - Motivation
    - Reason to believe hypothesis
    - Dead ends
    - Pause projects
    - ...
- What does the business do? Really?
  - MacDonald is a real estate company
- Having Junior Team Members is a great forcing function!
  - They are not jaded, and willing to ask senior members won't ask

**Questions**

- Different company have different ways to value data assets
- Documentation is to business is code is to product
  - Not yet generalizable
  - Atlassian Confluence: Centralized indexing + Plugins (mediocere solutions)
