excerpt: Acquiring data for data visualization

This morning I tweeted:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/figure/2017-03-07/tweet.png" style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 80%" />

In this post, I will therefore be working with `matplotlib`. In terms of data visualization, I'm more familiar with R and ggplot2, and so this is a perfect opportunity to explore matplotlib. But first I will need data.


The Jupyter Notebook for this little project is found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/csiu/100daysofcode/blob/master/lol/acquiring-data.ipynb).


### Acquiring the data for data visualization

*What data should I use?*

As I was asking my younger brother this question, he had League of Legends (LOL) -- a multiplayer online battle arena video game -- open on his computer screen. Visualizing game data is always fun, and so my brother suggested to use data from the [League of Legends: Base champion statistics](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Base_champion_statistics) website.

 <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/figure/2017-03-07/lol-webpage.png" style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 100%" />

And so, I proceeded to scrape the text off the webpage using `BeautifulSoup`.

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

website_to_parse = "http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Base_champion_statistics"

# Save HTML to soup
html_data = requests.get(website_base_stats).text
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_data, "html5lib")

# Parse table and save to pandas data frame
table = soup.find('table', attrs={'class' : 'wikitable'})
table_body = table.tbody

data = []
rows = table_body.find_all('tr')
for row in rows:
    cols = row.find_all('td')
    if len(cols) == 0: continue
    cols[0] = cols[0].span
    cols = [c.text.strip() for c in cols]
    data.append(cols)

lol_thead = [h.text.strip() for h in soup.find_all("th")]
lol_table = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=lol_thead)
```
Now that we have data, we can plot.

### Data visualization with matplotlib

According to the [matplotlib cheatsheet](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/Python_Matplotlib_Cheat_Sheet.pdf) that was tweeted this morning, the components of plotting with matplotlib are:

1. Prepare The Data
2. Create Plot
3. (Use) Plotting Routines
4. Customize Plot
5. Save Plot
6. Show Plot

### Preparing the data

The data scraped from the webpage was not in the right format, and further preprocessing steps (mainly the conversion of strings to floats) were required.

### Plotting

The following plots were created by ...

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/figure/2017-03-07/day11.png" style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 100%" />

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create my plots
fig = plt.figure()
```

**Plot 1**

```python
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(221)
ax1.title.set_text('Plot 1')

ax1.scatter(x=lol_table.HP, y=lol_table.Range)
```

- a generic `scatter`-plot with no extra customizations

**Plot2**

```python
ax2.title.set_text('Plot 2')
ax2 = fig.add_subplot(222)

ax2.scatter(x=lol_table.HP, y=lol_table.Range)
ax2.spines['top'].set_visible(False)
ax2.spines['right'].set_visible(False)
ax2.set(xlabel = "HP", ylabel = "Ranage")
```

- the top and right plot borders were removed with `spines`
- x and y axis labels were `set`

**Plot3**

```python
ax3 = fig.add_subplot(223)
ax3.title.set_text('Plot 3')

ax3.scatter(x=lol_table.HP, y=lol_table.Range)
for vline in range(300, 700, 100):
    ax3.axvline(vline, color="grey", linestyle="dashed", linewidth=0.5)
ax3.xaxis.set(
    ticks=range(300, 700, 100),
    ticklabels=["HP:{}".format(x) for x in range(300, 700, 50)]
)
```

- vertical lines were added and customized with `axvlines`
- x-axis breaks and labels were set with `xaxis.set`

**Plot4**

```python
ax4 = fig.add_subplot(224)
ax4.title.set_text('Plot 4')

ax4.scatter(x=lol_table.HP, y=lol_table.Range, marker="+", color="red")
ax4.set(
    xlim=[450, 650],
    ylim=[400, 700]
)
ax4.text(600, 550, "Zoom!", style='italic', fontsize="x-large")
```

- marker type and colour on the scatter plot were specified
- x and y limits were `set`
- `text` was added to the plot

In conclusion, use matplotlib.
