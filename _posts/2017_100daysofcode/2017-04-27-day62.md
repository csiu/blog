excerpt: Exploring the Sberbank Russian Housing Market dataset on a Kaggle kernel
---

A new competition was announced on twitter today, and I wanted to explore the data using a Kaggle kernel.

### Using Kaggle kernels

**Kaggle kernels** are located in the "Kernels" section of a Kaggle competition are used to experiment with a competition's data and to share techniques. Reading through a couple of kernels written by other Kaggle users, I found it very conductive to learning new ways to handle, explore, and work with data.

*I wanted to share a Kaggle kernel too.*

### My experience with Kaggle kernels

Today I thought I would explore the [Sberbank](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sberbank-russian-housing-market) dataset using a Kaggle kernel. I thought it would be simple, quick, and easy to do.

*I was wrong.*

The Kaggle kernel had its own keyboard shortcuts (different from the Jupyter Notebook ones I'm used to).

*It was not simple.*

The Kaggle kernel kept on disconnecting, reconnecting, and/or restarting (which slowed everything down).

*It was not quick.*

The Kaggle kernel sometimes disconnect and wipe all progress I made up to an earlier "saved point" (which I did not specify and so significant parts of my code went missing).

*The kernel was not easy.*

The first two issues, I'm okay with. But after having to restart from scratch multiple times (and feeling worst and worst after each restart), I drew a line. This is the [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/celiasiu/sberbank-russian-housing-market/question-notebook-wiped-as-it-s-being-written) I left off at. I am not particularly satisfied with this work (but I need sleep because I'll be going on a road trip with a couple of friends) and so I will do a proper analysis (away from Kaggle kernels) on my local machine and share that work.
