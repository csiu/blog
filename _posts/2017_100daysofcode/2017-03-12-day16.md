### PostgreSQL: Introduction
- also referred to as "Postgres"
- an object-relational database (ORDBMS)
- functions to store data securely
- functions to return data in response to requests from other software applications
- is ACID-compliant (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability)
- is transactional
- has native programming interfaces for C/C++, Java, .Net, Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, ODBC, among others
- manages concurrency by multiversion concurrency control (MVCC), which gives each transaction a "snapshot" of the database, allowing changes to be made without being visible to other transactions until the changes are committed

Reference: [https://www.postgresql.org/about/](https://www.postgresql.org/about/)

### Installation

There is a number of ways to [download & install Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). Since I'm working in MacOS, I installed Postgres with Homebrew.

```
# Update Homebrew
brew update
brew doctor

# Install Postgres
brew install postgresql
```

Reference: [How to install PostgreSQL on a Mac with Homebrew and Lunchy]() (Moncef Belyamani, 2012)

### Create a database

Now that Postgres is installed, we can create a database.

```
# init Postgres
initdb postgres

# start the postgres server
pg_ctl -D postgres start

# create your database
createdb mydb
```

- `initdb postgres -E utf8` is used to create a new PostgreSQL database cluster
    - *-E utf8* specifies the encoding to be utf8.
- `pg_ctl -D postgres -l logfile start` is used to start the database server; it can also be used to initialize, start, stop (`pg_ctl -D postgres stop`), or control a PostgreSQL server
    - *-D postgres* specifies the file system location of the database configuration files
    - *-l logfile* appends the server log output to specified filename
    - *start* launches a new server
- `createdb` is used to create a new PostgreSQL database

### psql

`psql` is used to start a PostgreSQL interactive terminal. In the "help" (accessed by `\h`), we are given the following:

### Make a table

Example taken from: [How To Install and Use PostgreSQL on Ubuntu 16.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-postgresql-on-ubuntu-16-04#create-and-delete-tables)

*To create a new table ...*

```
CREATE TABLE playground (
    equip_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    type varchar (50) NOT NULL,
    color varchar (25) NOT NULL,
    location varchar(25) check (location in ('north', 'south', 'west', 'east', 'northeast', 'southeast', 'southwest', 'northwest')),
    install_date date
);
```

- `\d` to see new table and `\dt` to see just the table without the *sequence* (a representation of the serial type given to the "equip_id" column).

*To add records to the table ...*

```
INSERT INTO playground (type, color, location, install_date) VALUES ('slide', 'blue', 'south', '2014-04-28');

INSERT INTO playground (type, color, location, install_date) VALUES ('swing', 'yellow', 'northwest', '2010-08-16');
```

*To query the table ...*

```
SELECT * FROM playground;
```

*To delete records from the table ...*

```
DELETE FROM playground WHERE type = 'slide';
```

The output looks as follows:

### Start/Stop Postgres as a background service at startup

You can also setup your Mac to start (or stop) Postgres as a background service at startup.

```
# brew tap homebrew/services

brew services start postgresql
brew services stop postgresql

brew services restart postgresql
```
