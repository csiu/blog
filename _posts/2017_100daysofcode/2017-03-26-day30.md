Yesterday’s failure brings today’s success. Sometimes you need to stop, take a look at the problem from another angle, and refer back to a working solution. The working solution I referred to is [craffel@github's Lasagne Tutorial](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/craffel/Lasagne-tutorial/blob/master/examples/tutorial.ipynb).

### Debugging yesterday's error

In getting a convolutional neural network (CNN) to run, I realized the format of my input data was incorrectly specified. Originally, the data was formatted as a matrix (features along the columns and samples along the rows). The correct format is a nested data structure: `dataset[sample][channel][row][column]`.

```
# Here is an example of the first sample in the correct format
# Data is found in only 1 "channel"
# (eg. notice the 2x square brackets before the first list of data)

array([[ [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],
         [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],
         [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],
         ...,
         [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],
         [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],
         [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.]  ]], dtype=float32)
```

Another problem I discovered was that when specifying the input layer's `shape`, an error is returned if I specify the number of examples (n_examples), but no error is returned when `None` is used.

```
l_in = lasagne.layers.InputLayer(
  shape=(n_examples, n_channels, width, height))
```

### Script: 5 main sections to make & run a CNN

1. Load the data
2. Define the CNN network structure
3. Define the learning<br>(eg. what the error function is and how the network gets updated)
4. Define the classification/get output function<br>(for computing the network's output given an input)
5. Do the training
