excerpt: When did I make my commits?
---

*We made it! Today is Day100 of 100 days of code!!*

For the last day, I want to see when I made my commits. In other words, when did I actually post for each of the 100 days.

The R Markdown for this little project is found [here](https://github.com/csiu/100daysofcode/blob/master/misc/day100/day100.md).

## Getting the data

But before I can get my answer, I need data. These posts were committed to Github using git (a version control system), which I can use to tracks *when*  the commits where made. To get all the commits made on the master branch, I use:

`git log master > git-commits.blog.2017-06-04.log`

Now that I have the date and time information of all commits, further processing is needed to wrangle the data to a workable format:

```

cat git-commits.blog.2017-06-04.log |
  grep -A2 ^Date |
  perl -pe 's|^\s+||' |
  grep -vE '^-{0,2}$' |
  tr '\n' '\t' |
  perl -pe 's|$|\n|; s|Date|\nDate|g' |
  perl -pe 's|\t$||g; s|^Date:\s{4}||' |
  grep -v "^$" > \
    git-commits.blog.2017-06-04.txt
```

*The bash one-liner is ugly, but it does its job.*

## Number of commits

Reading the data into R, I need to properly handle the date and time information. I do this by using functions from the `lubridate` R package (see the [R Markdown](https://github.com/csiu/100daysofcode/blob/master/misc/day100/day100.md) for details).

> **100 Days of Code**: 2017-02-25 to 2017-06-04

Restricting the commits to be within the 100 days, I find 160 commits. Ideally there is one commit per day for each of the 100 days, but this was obviously not the case.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/figure/2017-06-04/hist-commit.png" style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 100%" />

When I tally the commits, most commits in a day were made during the second week of April (*a couple days before my Whistler trip*).

## Commit times

Another good question to ask is: what time do I generally make my commits.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/figure/2017-06-04/dot-commit.png" style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 100%" />

Centering the commits around midnight, we can see there are a couple *nice-let-me-sleep-early* ones made around 10PM and some *not-nice-I-probably-won't-get-much-sleep-and-would-need-caffeine* ones past 2 in the morning (such would be the case for Day 100 as well).

For the most part, commits to the 100 days of code were made past midnight.

*\*Sigh, at least I am consistent.*

## What next?

Now that this side project has reached its end, I will have time on my hand to concentrate on other projects. In the near future, I want to reorganize this project so that its nicely laid out and searchable.
