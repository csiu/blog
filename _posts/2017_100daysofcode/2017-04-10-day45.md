As a break, I thought I would spruce up my old [GitHub repos](https://github.com/csiu?tab=repositories). By no means is this task complete. This is just the start.

### GitHub repos

I have 29 GitHub repositories ("repos"), 18 of which are public.

**Status: I'm okay with these**

With regards to my MSc code base (set to private for now), I plan refactor the code (so it's in a less embarrassing state) and make it public.

### ASIDE: Writing markdown table

Writing markdown tables is a pain. Too much typing is involved -- especially writing the line between the header and data rows. I therefore wrote a simple shell script to take simple input and reformat it into proper markdown table format.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/csiu/5530c41d8a7d649eae6be32ebff435cb.js"></script>

Here is an example of simple input:

```
Header1 | Header2 | Header3
row1-col | row1-col2 | row1-col3
next row = row2 | add more text | harder to read
```

and the resulting properly markdown table reformatted output:

```
| Header1 | Header2 | Header3 |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| row1-col | row1-col2 | row1-col3 |
| next row = row2 | add more text | harder to read |
```

*It's funny. I wrote the script first, but it turns out it wasn't really that useful for writing this post. \-\- csiu*
