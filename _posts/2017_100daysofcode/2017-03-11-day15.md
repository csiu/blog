excerpt: In the spirit of software development/engineering and continuous testing, we add some unit tests to yesterday's R package
---

Yesterday I presented [`hmmpickr`](https://github.com/csiu/hmmpickr), an R package to quantitatively help pick the hidden Markov model whose states are the most well-defined. Today we [add some unit tests](https://github.com/csiu/hmmpickr/commit/7602d813d010fe1e799882aafb3b07b78d856d31).


### Unit testing

> Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software **performs as designed**. (From [Software Testing Fundamentals](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/))

> [Unit testing] is a very efficient and easy way to make sure all your functions are working properly and to **detect bugs** in your code as soon as possible ([Thiago G. Martins, 2013](https://tgmstat.wordpress.com/2013/06/26/devtools-and-testthat-r-packages/))

### testthat

I make use of the [`testthat`](https://github.com/hadley/testthat) package to add unit tests to my R package. testthat is a package developed by Hadley Wickham to "make testing as fun as possible".

- [testthat: Get Started with Testing](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2011-1/RJournal_2011-1_Wickham.pdf) by Hadley Wickham (2011) -- reference

### Basic architecture

A `tests/` directory is created and inside this directory is a `test-all.R` script which uses `testthat::test_check(...)` to tell R to run all tests in an installed package. Tests should be placed in `tests/testthat/`.

```
|-- DESCRIPTION
|-- NAMESPACE
|-- R/
|-- man/

|-- tests/
|   |-- test-all.R
|   |-- testthat/
|   |   |-- ...
```

Unit tests can be ran automatically with `R CMD check`.

### Example:

```r
context("Loading")

test_that("load_chromhmm_model creates a list of 3", {
  model_file <-
    system.file("extdata", "model_roadmap15.txt", package="hmmpickr")

  m <- load_chromhmm_model(model_file)

  expect_that(m, is_a("list"))

  expect_length(m, 3)

  expect_equal(names(m), c("num_states", "emissions", "transitions"))

  expect_that(m$num_states, is_a("numeric"))
  expect_that(m$emissions, is_a("data.frame"))
  expect_that(m$transitions, is_a("data.frame"))

  expect_equal(names(m$emissions), c("state", "mark", "markname", "prob"))
  expect_equal(names(m$transitions), c("from", "to", "prob"))
})
```

A good practice is to first run the unit tests before committing changes to the code.
