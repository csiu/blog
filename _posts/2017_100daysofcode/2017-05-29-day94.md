excerpt: Bagging = decision trees made from sampling with replacement

Another procedure I heard about is **bagging**.

The Jupyter Notebook for this little project is found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/csiu/kaggle/blob/master/house_prices/day94-bagging.ipynb).

### Bagging

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_aggregating), bagging stands for stands for "bootstrap aggregating", a special case of model averaging designed to improve stability and accuracy & reduce reduce variability and overfitting. Bagging is applied by:

1. Generating a "bootstrap sample" by *sampling with replacement* (where the number of samples in the bootstrap sample is equal to the number of samples in the original dataset)
2. Constructing a regression tree from the bootstrap sample
3. Repeating steps 1-2 to get `B` regression trees
4. Combining the `B` outputs by averaging (for regression) or voting (for classification)

In python, bagging can be specified using Scikit-learn's [`sklearn.ensemble.BaggingClassifier`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.BaggingClassifier.html) function.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier

clf = BaggingClassifier()
clf = clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Predicting on the House Prices dataset

Using the same [Kaggle House Prices for Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) dataset as described yesterday ([Day93]({{ site.baseurl }}/update/2017/05/28/day93.html)), the prediction accuracy is comparable.

**Yesterday's**

**Today's**

In the bagging methods, we also see that (up to a point) more trees results to higher accuracy.
