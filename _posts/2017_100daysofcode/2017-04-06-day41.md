excerpt: Getting topics from string representation of dictionaries.

Today I extract the annotated categories from the downloaded [Web Robots Kickstarter information]({{ site.baseurl }}/update/2017/04/05/day40.html).

```

### Consistency in file structure

Before I begin, I want to ensure the structure of the 44 Kickstarter data files are all the same such that when I apply my methods to one file, these methods also apply to the other files. A quick look at the header `head Kick*csv | grep "^id" | uniq` shows that all headers are the same:

    id,photo,name,blurb,goal,pledged,state,slug,disable_communication,country,currency,currency_symbol,currency_trailing_code,deadline,state_changed_at,created_at,launched_at,staff_pick,backers_count,static_usd_rate,usd_pledged,creator,location,category,profile,spotlight,urls,source_url,friends,is_starred,is_backing,permissions

When we count the number of lines minus the header, there are 185,367 projects scrapped from Kickstarter.

### Category labels from column "category"

One of the things I plan to do on [<i class="fa fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/csiu/kick) is topic modelling. But before I do this, I want some sense of what topic each project is about. In the Web Robots data, we find the entries of column "category" as a string representation of a dictionary.

    {"urls":{"web":{"discover":"http://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/film%20&%20video/television"}},"color":16734574,"parent_id":11,"name":"Television","id":303,"position":17,"slug":"film & video/television"}

 According to [Jacob Gabrielson, 2009](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/988228/convert-a-string-representation-of-a-dictionary-to-a-dictionary), you can convert a string representation of a dictionary to a dictionary with `ast.literal_eval` (which is safer than using `eval`).

```python
import ast

df['topic'] = df['category'].map(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x)['name'])
```

*Originally I plan to load the data into a Postgres database for today's entry, but I kept on getting errors. It's late and so I will do the creating of a new database, tables, and loading of data tomorrow. \-\- csiu*
