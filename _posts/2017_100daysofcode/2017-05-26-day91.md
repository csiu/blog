excerpt: Figuring out how to install a custom package with pip
---

I outlined the project yesterday, because I knew I wouldn't have much time today to work on it.

*I was right.*

Yesterday I created a minimal python package, today I want to be able to install this package with `pip`.

The repo for this little project is found [<i class="fa fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/csiu/sample-python-package).

## Creating the necessary setup file

According to the [python-package](https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/minimal.html), `pip` uses the "setup.py" config file for installation. This file is located outside the package and contains the instructions to pip for installation.

```python
# Content of setup.py
from setuptools import setup

setup(name='mypackage',
      version='0.1',
      author='Celia Siu',
      author_email='fake-email@example.com',
      url='http://github.com/csiu/sample-python-package',
      description='Sample python package',
      long_description='',
      license='MIT',
      zip_safe=False)
```

## Installation with `pip`

Once the setup file is created and located in the right place, running pip in the "sample-python-package" project directory will install the package for use on our system.

My file structure now looks like this:

```
-- sample-python-package/
   |-- mypackage/
   |   |-- __init__.py
   |   |-- test1.py
   |-- setup.py
```

And the result of `pip install .` is:

```
Processing /Users/csiu/repo/sample-python-package
  Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): mypackage==0.1 from file:///Users/csiu/repo/sample-python-package in /Users/csiu/software/anaconda/anaconda2-4.0.0/lib/python2.7/site-packages
Building wheels for collected packages: mypackage
  Running setup.py bdist_wheel for mypackage ... done
  Stored in directory: /Users/csiu/Library/Caches/pip/wheels/d5/c9/8b/9e90448482702fc6c561373478bc0bffa0815d9d077217ae68
Successfully built mypackage
```

*In the last line we see the package has been "Successfully built".*

## Future work

Now that I have a minimal python package with pip installation working, I want to:

- Enable continuous integration with Travis
