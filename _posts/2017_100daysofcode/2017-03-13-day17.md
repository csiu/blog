excerpt: Adding data to PostgreSQL
---

[Yesterday]({{ site.baseurl }}/update/2017/03/12/day16.html) we installed Postgres, today we add in data from a dataset. The data we'll be using is from Kaggle: [Human Resources Analytics](https://www.kaggle.com/ludobenistant/hr-analytics). The fields in the dataset include:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/figure/2017-03-13/hr-field.png" style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 99%" />

The first 5 lines of the dataset are:

```
satisfaction_level,last_evaluation,number_project,average_montly_hours,time_spend_company,Work_accident,left,promotion_last_5years,sales,salary
0.38,0.53,2,157,3,0,1,0,sales,low
0.8,0.86,5,262,6,0,1,0,sales,medium
0.11,0.88,7,272,4,0,1,0,sales,medium
0.72,0.87,5,223,5,0,1,0,sales,low
```

### Creating the "hr" database

We first create the database.

```
initdb postgres
pg_ctl -D postgres -l logfile start
createdb hr

psql hr
```

### Creating the table

We next create the table "survey" storing the hr information.

```
CREATE TABLE survey (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  satisfaction_level numeric,
  last_evaluation numeric,
  number_project integer,
  average_montly_hours integer,
  time_spend_company integer,
  work_accident boolean,
  left_workplace boolean,
  promotion_last_5years boolean,
  sales varchar,
  salary varchar
);
```

- Reference: [PostgreSQL - Data Types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/datatype.html)

### Importing the data

#### Single record

```
INSERT INTO survey (satisfaction_level, last_evaluation, number_project, average_montly_hours, time_spend_company, work_accident, left_workplace, promotion_last_5years, sales, salary) VALUES (0.38, 0.53, 2, 157, 3, '0', '1', '0', 'sales', 'low');
```

*When we have many records, inserting one by one is somewhat laborious.*

#### Many records in bulk with `COPY`

```
COPY survey (satisfaction_level, last_evaluation, number_project, average_montly_hours, time_spend_company, work_accident, left_workplace, promotion_last_5years, sales, salary)
FROM '/Users/csiu/repo/kaggle/hr/data/import-me.csv'
WITH CSV HEADER;
```

We `COPY` into table "survey" by specifying the columns. This makes it so that the primary key is populated with values from the sequence.

> The copy command allows you to specify which columns to populate. If [we] omit the id column, it will be populated with the values from the sequence ([a_horse_with_no_name, 2015](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29963242/how-to-increment-primary-key-during-postgres-copy-batch-insert))

We also indicate which file to copy `FROM`, and `WITH` what options. Option "CSV" and "HEADER" indicates the file is a comma-separated-values file and that there is header that needs to be skipped during import.

---

The import-me.csv file is generated as follows:

```python
with open("import-me.csv", 'w') as out:
    with open("HR_comma_sep.csv") as f:
        for line in f:
            line = line.strip().split(",")
            line = ','.join(line[:5] + ['"'+i+'"' for i in line[5:]]) + '\n'
            out.write(line)
```

```
satisfaction_level,last_evaluation,number_project,average_montly_hours,time_spend_company,"Work_accident","left","promotion_last_5years","sales","salary"
0.38,0.53,2,157,3,"0","1","0","sales","low"
0.8,0.86,5,262,6,"0","1","0","sales","medium"
0.11,0.88,7,272,4,"0","1","0","sales","medium"
0.72,0.87,5,223,5,"0","1","0","sales","low"
```

*In the screenshot, we (1) created the table, (2) successfully imported 14,999 records, and (3) displayed the first 10 records.*

### Querying the database

Now that the data is in the database, we can make some queries. For instance, counting the number of records for the different levels of salary or the number of records for the different departments in which they work for.

```
hr=# SELECT salary,count(*) FROM survey GROUP BY salary;
 salary | count
--------+-------
 low    |  7316
 medium |  6446
 high   |  1237
(3 rows)

hr=# SELECT sales,count(*) FROM survey GROUP BY sales;
    sales    | count
-------------+-------
 accounting  |   767
 technical   |  2720
 marketing   |   858
 sales       |  4140
 IT          |  1227
 management  |   630
 support     |  2229
 product_mng |   902
 hr          |   739
 RandD       |   787
(10 rows)
```

### Summary

Overall, we created a database and imported data. In a later post, we will do something with this data.
