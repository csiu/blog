Today I wanted to explore another dataset from the [Vancouver Open Data Catalogue](http://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/).

> **Data:**\\
> [Open Data Catalogue: Food Vendors](http://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/foodVendors.htm)\\
> This data set has 94 food vendors.


The R Markdown for this little project is found [here](https://github.com/csiu/100daysofcode/blob/master/misc/day83.Rmd).

## Questions

For this dataset, I had the following questions:

- What type of businesses are there?
- Where are the food vendors?

## Mainly hot dogs in Vancouver

When we plot the different types of street food vendors, we find that in Vancouver it's mainly hot dogs.

Looking into the hot dog business futhers, we find the majority of known businesses is a Japadog.

## Food vendors are mainly downtown

Plotting the food vendors on a map, we find that most vendors are located downtown.

Here we can also easily find 1 (outlier) hot dog vendor in the southern part Vancouver (the business name is missing).
