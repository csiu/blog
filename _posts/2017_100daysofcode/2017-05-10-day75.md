excerpt: 'Emojis tweeted to #BCVotes2017'
---

Yesterday was the BC Election day. Today I want to see what emojis were tweeted during the election day (May 9th, 2017) to [#BCVotes2017](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BCVotes2017&src=tyah).

The R Markdown for this little project is found [here](https://gist.github.com/csiu/d14c5c66cd84f3192ef7311a356d9ab0).


## Workflows

1. Connect to Twitter and obtain tweets from specific hashtag
2. Tidy tweets
3. Count number of emojis
4. Visualize plot

## Results

- Most people tweeted the "white heavy check mark"
- The "fearful face" was interestingly more popular then the "smiling face with smiling eyes" and the "smiling face with open mouth and smiling eyes"
- Same number of people tweeted the "thumbs up sign" and "winking face"

### Future work

- Figure out why not all emojis were displayed
- Compare the emojis posted after the election
