excerpt: Classify handwritten digits using the famous MNIST data
---

Day05 brings another Kaggle competition, "[Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer)". The goal in this competition is to take an image of a handwritten single digit, and determine what that digit is.

The Jupyter Notebook for this little project is found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/csiu/kaggle/blob/master/digit_recognizer/DigitRecognizer-randomforest.ipynb).

### Random Forest

Today, I think I'll use a random forest classifier. A random forest classifier is like an election where the outcome with the most votes (from the *ensemble* of decision trees) is the predicted classification. Here is a minimal example of how this is done in Python:

```
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

rfc = RandomForestClassifier()
rfc = fit(X_train, y_train)

rfc.predict(X_test)
```

### Number of trees?

I split the train data into 2 sets: 80% for training and 20% for validation. I then (crudely) optimized for the number of trees (default = 10 trees) and decided that 30 trees is as good as 100 trees.

*With more trees, comes greater training time.*

### Evaluation

Submitting the results to kaggle, we get a public score of "0.95871".
