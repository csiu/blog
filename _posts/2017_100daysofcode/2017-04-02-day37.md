excerpt: Exploring pesticide residues in food

Today, I want to try something new (and to take a look at pesticide data). The data I use comes from Kaggle's [Pesticide Data Program (2015)](https://www.kaggle.com/usdeptofag/pesticide-data-program-2015/kernels) data set uploaded by the United States Department of Agriculture.

My workflow is in R and the markdown document for this little project is found [here](https://github.com/csiu/kaggle/blob/master/pest/day37_explore-pest.md). (You can also find the R Markdown document in the sample directory, but it's less pretty.)

### Data from an SQLite database

The Kaggle data was stored in an SQLite database and the `DBI` library was used to connect to and extract data from this database.

```r
library(DBI)

con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname="data/database.sqlite")
results <- dbGetQuery(con, 'SELECT * FROM resultsdata15')
dbDisconnect(con)
```

### Dealing with missing data

There are 2,333,911 rows and 16 columns in the results data frame; however, not all columns are complete. Some columns contain missing data:

```r
# How many NAs per column?
(na_in_column <-
  colSums(is.na(results))) %>%
  sort(decreasing = TRUE) %>%
  as.data.frame()
```

```
##              num_na
## confmethod2 2333911
## quantitate  2331898
## annotate    2329076
## concen      2295160
## confmethod  2295160
## sample_pk         0
## commod            0
## commtype          0
## lab               0
## pestcode          0
## testclass         0
## lod               0
## conunit           0
## mean              0
## extract           0
## determin          0
```

To deal with this, we remove the columns with NAs.

```r
## Remove columns with NAs
results <- results[na_in_column==0]
```

We are left with 11 columns:

- `sample_pk`
- `commod` - COMMODITY TYPE in 2015 PDP Samples
- `commtype` - COMMODITIES Sampled/Analyzed by PDP in 2015 (Fresh Product Unless Otherwise Noted)
- `lab` - PDP Participating LABORATORIES in 2015
- `pestcode` - Compounds (PESTICIDES) Analyzed by PDP
- `testclass` - TEST (COMPOUND) CLASS in 2015 PDP Analytical Results
- `lod` - Limit of Detection
- `conunit` - Concentration/LOD Unit-of-Measure Code
- `mean` - MEAN RESULT in 2014 PDP Analytical Results (O, A, and R indicated Positive Detections)
- `extract` - EXTRACTION METHOD in 2015 PDP Analytical Results
- `determin` - DETERMINATIVE METHOD in 2015 PDP Analytical Results

### Start with a simple question

Before I doing some heavy analysis, I want to know:

*Which commodity type has the highest detected level of pesticides?*

A simple boxplot will do:

```r
# Get my data
select(code$commod, code, label) %>%
  right_join(results, by = c("code"="commod")) %>%
  mutate(label = ifelse(is.na(label), code, label)) %>%
  plyr::rename(c("label" = "commod")) %>%

  # Plot
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(commod, lod, FUN=median),
             y = lod, fill = commtype)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  xlab("Commodities") +
  ylab("Limit of Detection in Parts-per-Million") +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5)
  )
```

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/figure/2017-04-02/box-commod-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

_In the figure, the commodities (along x-axis) are sorted by median limit of pesticide detection. Commodity codes are replaced with the commodity labels if they are [available](https://www.kaggle.com/usdeptofag/pesticide-data-program-2015). Boxplots are coloured by the commodity type, where "FR" is fresh, "FZ" is frozen, and "OT" is other._

We find "PB" has the highest level of pesticide limit of detection and that cherries are also (surprisingly) at the top of the list.
