excerpt: Figuring out how to enable continuous integration with Travis
---

In the next part of creating a simple python package, I figure out how to enable continuous integration with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) on the minimal python package [<i class="fa fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/csiu/sample-python-package) which I started a couple days ago.

> In software engineering, [continuous integration (CI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) is the practice of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.

### Travis CI

While discussing good software practices with people, I often hear about Travis CI or see a ".travis.yml" file in a GitHub repo.

According to [Joshua Anderson](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22587148/trying-to-understand-what-travis-ci-does-and-when-it-should-be-used) (stackoverflow, 2014), Travis CI will run your program's tests every time you commit to GitHub, which will quickly tell if your commit was okay or the commit broke something and you need to fix it before it becomes a problem.

### Using Travis CI

[To get started with Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/), you do the following:

1. Sign in to Travis CI with your GitHub account
2. Enable repos (on the [profile page](https://travis-ci.org/profile)) to use Travis CI
3. Add a `.travis.yml` file to the repos (to tell Travis CI what to build)
4. Trigger your first build with a git push
5. Check the [build status](https://travis-ci.org) page to see if your build passes or fails

### Specifying the ".travis.yml" file

Looking in the [python](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/python/) specification of `.travis.yml`, to use Travis I (1) specified the Python version, and (2) specified the command to test the software.

```yaml
language: python
python:
  - "2.7"
# command to run tests
script:
  - python setup.py test
```

Here `python setup.py test` will be used to run the tests. Other examples I seen for testing the software is to specify the tests in a `py.test` file.
