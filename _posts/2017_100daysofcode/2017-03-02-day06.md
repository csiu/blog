DAY 06 - Mar 2, 2017

### Data Science meetup

Today I went to the [Data Science meetup for "Using NLP & Machine Learning to understand and predict performance"](https://www.meetup.com/DataScience/events/237733099/). Fascinating stuff. Somewhat similar to my thesis work and the talk inspired a few ideas for future projects.


```python
speaker = 'Thomas Levi'
topics_mentioned_at_meetup = [
    "latent dirichlet allocation",
    "collapsed gibbs sampling",
    "bayesian inference",
    "topic modelling",
    "porter stemmer",
    "flesch reading ease",
    "word2vec"
]
```

```python
for t in topics_mentioned_at_meetup:
    print("- '{}' was mentioned".format(t))
```

    - 'latent dirichlet allocation' was mentioned
    - 'collapsed gibbs sampling' was mentioned
    - 'bayesian inference' was mentioned
    - 'topic modelling' was mentioned
    - 'porter stemmer' was mentioned
    - 'flesch reading ease' was mentioned
    - 'word2vec' was mentioned


*Anyways, I just got home and now (as I'm typing this) have 35 minutes to do something and post it for Day06.*

### Jupyter Notebook meet Jekyll blog post

Going back to a comment I recently recieved about including and embedding code to my jekyll blog posts. I thought I would tackle this problem now. The issue is that I use Jupyter Notebooks to explore and analyze data but I haven't really looked at its integration with the Jekyll blog post. Until now.

### Integration with Jekyll

1. Add yaml front matter to the top of the Jupyter Notebook
2. Convert Jupyter Notebook to markdown by<br>
      `jupyter nbconvert --to markdown NOTEBOOK.ipynb`
3. Delete empty first line of markdown/*minor adjustments*.

The original Jupyter Notebook is found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/csiu/100daysofcode/blob/master/misc/2017-03-02-day06.ipynb).
