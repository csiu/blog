## **Keynote |** Contexts & Institutions

Saving and indexing research quality federal environmental and climate data.

> Laurie Allen\\
> <a href="https://twitter.com/librlaurie" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false">Follow @librlaurie</a><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

- Laurie is a librarian involved with data rescue and is a "rogue scientist" to save climate data from Trump
- [DataRefuge](https://www.datarefuge.org)
  - formed over the concerns about the disappearance of research quality ("real") federal environmental and climate data. The risk is real.
  - The goal is to save copies of federal data
  - Would like to see events regarding designated communities (to identity data in communities that should be saved and to save it)
- How do you slice and dice federal information?
  - There is no list
  - You can organize by data format & size, agency that produced the data, covered by federal records laws, or most valuable & vulnerable first
  - No perfect way to slice and dice federal information
  - Types of vulnerabilities: legal, technical, political, use & uniqueness of the data
- Event paths
  - Seed & sort webpages (from WayBack Machine)
  - DataRefuge: harvest, check, bag, describe the data
  - Storytelling (one way of saving data, is to understand the data)
  - long trail (what to do in future to make it more sustainable)
- Codification: spreadsheets -> workflow -> web app -> system
  - Still work to be done eg. description is not quite clear what data is for
  - Shout out to Environmental Data & Governance Initiative (EDGI)
- [Dat Project](https://datproject.org) & notion of [Frictionless data](http://frictionlessdata.io)
- Multiple meaning of metadata
  - Metadata, paradata (universe of things one need to know to work with data) and software preservation
  - When data is given to another person, there are assumptions in place to what the other person knows
  - "Metadata is a love letter to the future" -- Rachel Appel who was quoting someone else
- Institutions have lots of barriers
  - But we need to build communities within and across institutions
- Federal deposit repositories is for when federal priorities change (they always do)
- *Miss [Adelaide R Hasse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Hasse) Librarian, Office of Public Documents*
- **data ~ stories**; data and stories are deeply connected
- Q&A
  - U.S. produce massive amounts of data and is used by international collaborations/groups
  - How to make the internet better at not destroying things? Hard problem. Sending HTML file is probably not the way to go.

## Trends in Data in Time and Space

Analyzing geolocation data

> [Location - Trends in Time and Place](https://csvconf.com/speakers/#christopher-moravec) -- Christopher Moravec\\
> <a href="https://twitter.com/Mor3Havoc" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false">Follow @Mor3Havoc</a><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

- Spacial reference of location
  - There are different types of coordinate systems for location data
  - Examples: latitude, longitude, address (geocoding), zip code, city, county, state, country
- Locating anything is about scale
  - Consider how the location is grouped/aggregated
  - eg. world cities, portland city limits, zip codes
  - select the locate type depending on scale
  - **create custom bins** for analysis
  - zip codes are polygons & not always within city limits (eg. zip codes in Flint averaged the problems away)
- Spatial Reference and Datum
  - "Earth is round and Maps are flats"
  - "Earth is round, sort of"
- Calculating distance in latitude and longitude is false
- Heat Maps (tells how dense stuff is, but can also hide data) vs Hot Spots (look at statistical trend)
- Voter Registration Data with [Hack Oregon](http://www.hackoregon.org)
  - Hot spot analysis for the number of people on a grid over time
  - Looking from the map point of view from the start is the wrong way to go
  - Found that the average age of voters is getting older
  - Unable to find trends in space (probably because people are moving around a lot)
  - Number of voters in household is getting bigger (more young people staying at home?)
  - Mapping where young people go

## Using Web Archives to Enrich the Live Web Experience Through storytelling

Automatically telling stories by referencing web archives

> [Using Web Archives to Enrich the Live Web Experience Through Storytelling](https://csvconf.com/speakers/#yasmin-alnoamany) -- Yasmin AlNoamany\\
> <a href="https://twitter.com/yasmina_anwar" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false">Follow @yasmina_anwar</a><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

- [bit.ly/YasminPhD](http://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2016/09/2016-09-20-promising-scene-at-end-of.html) (slides)
- Repositories disappearing over the internet
  - Resources are not persistent
  - Web archives such as the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) and [Archive-it](https://archive-it.org) (subscription service from Internet archive) are services that archive the web
  - But understanding the content of web archives is not easy
- [**Storify**](https://storify.com) is a story tellings service
- Web archives contain 2 dimensions = {URI, time} & produce 4 types of stories:
  - Fixed page, fixed time
  - Fixed page, sliding time
  - Sliding page, fixed time
  - Sliding page, sliding time
- The [**Dark and Stormy Archives (DSA) framework**](http://digitalcommons.odu.edu/computerscience_etds/13/)
  - Establish baseline of social media stories
    - 28 mementos (quotes, pictures, videos, ...) is a good number for the resources
  - Detecting off-topic pages
    - Data base error, financial problems, hacking, domain expired
    - Duplicates
  - Selecting representative pages based on quality metrics and attractive snippets
  - Using Storify API to visualize stories
- Stories are generated automatically and evaluated with Mechanical Turk to compare human-generated stories and the automatically generated ones

## **Keynote |** Introducing d3.express, IDE for D3

Introducing [d3.express](https://d3.express) IDE (not ready yet) for making coding easier and javascript generators

> Mike Bostock\\
> <a href="https://twitter.com/mbostock" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false">Follow @mbostock</a><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing d3.​express: the integrated discovery environment. <a href="https://t.co/WfwCA9DDoD">https://t.co/WfwCA9DDoD</a></p>&mdash; Mike Bostock (@mbostock) <a href="https://twitter.com/mbostock/status/858015188959633408">April 28, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

- The purpose of visualization is insight, not pictures
- "Programming is blindly manipulating symbols" -- Bret Victor from 'Drawing Dynamic Visualization'
- Symptoms of inhuman code: convoluted, mutable state, inscrutable
- Code often best tool we have, because most general tool we have (code has un-parallel expressiveness; combination of primitives)

**Part 1. Reactivity**

- Care only about the current state
- Can inspect the array that is produced by clicking

```javascript
d3 = require("d3")
d3.csv("/path/to/file.csv")

d3.csv("/path/to/file.csv", d => {
  return {
    date: d.date,
    close: +d.close // + to convert string to number
  }
})
```

- Error is no longer global errors
- Order independent

```javascript
// Use function
parseTime = d3.timeParse("%d-%-%y")

d3.extend(data, d => d.date) //order independent

d3.csv("/path/to/file.csv", d => {
  return {
    date: parseTime(d.date),
    close: +d.close
  }
})
```

- curly braces for more involved definition

```javascript
{
  var svg = DOM.svg(width, height);
  return svg;
}
```

- it gets complicated real quick & harder to follow
- reactive programming let runtime handle it
- can use other software eg. `vegalite` to use d3.express
- **javascript generators** (is a pull system during runtime)

```javascript
// javascript generators
// variable = *{ ... yield ... }
projection = *{
	var projection = d3.geoOrthographic();
	while (true) {
		yield projection.rotate([Date.now()  200, -20]);
	}
}
```

- you can opt in more complexity (to avoid paying overhead cost of drawing, tossing, and redrawing)
- `viewof` operator is a shorthand
- `.call(bush)` to view data

**Part2: Visibility**

- interactive programming improves our ability to scrutinize behaviour by modifying the code
- geometry + intuition

**Part3: Reusability**

- Reusability enables you to write less code
- Passive code is the in between of 'one-off code' and an actively maintained library
- You can rewire definitions while importing

```
import {chart, width, height} with {data, y} from "filesignature"
```

**Part4: Portability**

- The notebook is intended to run in the browser
- Web-first environment lets your code run anywhere (no installation necessary)
- Reference: "Explorable Explanation" by Bret Victor
- Portable notebooks allow users to see how the code runs, and allow users to fork and modify the code for better understanding

## Opinionated Analysis Development

Shifting away from the blame culture

- Hilary's Podcast: Not So Standard Deviations
- Concepts: reproducible, accurate, collaborative
- Developing the narrative of the analysis
  - What models are you going to use?
  - What arguments are you going to make?
  - How are you going to convince your audience of something?
- Technical artifact
  - Tools you are going to use?
  - Technical and coding choice (tidyverse, R, python)
- Need to define the process
- Reference: [The Field Guide to Understanding 'Human Error'](https://www.amazon.com/Field-Guide-Understanding-Human-Error/dp/1472439058) by Sidney Dekker
  - Switch from "blaming" a person to blaming the process that they used
  - The person did not want to make an error
  - the current system failed the person with good intentions
  - Don't play the blame game
  - ["**Blameless PostMortems** and a Just Culture"](https://codeascraft.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/) - John Allspaw
  - Error occurs -> Blameless PostMortems -> Adopt a new process
  - Shift from "I know better than you", to there are "lots of people who have run into this problem before, and here's the software for solution"
- How not to win friends and influence people:
  - "Well ... Actually ..."
  - Arguing over twitter
  - Throw tools at them

## Applying software engineering to data analysis

> [Applying software engineering practises to data analysis](https://csvconf.com/speakers/#emil-bay) -- Emil Bay\\
> <a href="https://twitter.com/emilbayes" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false">Follow @emilbayes</a><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

- Emil is a founder of [CommodiTrader](http://commoditrader.com)
- Decoupling
  - Take program (that may be messy or doesn't scale well for human memory) and pull it a part so it's easier to see what is going on
- UNIX Philosophy
  - Write programs that do one thing and do it well
  - Write programs to work together
- Clear inputs and outputs to link programs together
  - Contract through \*rda (in R)
  - Checkpoint - "Save" computation (to intermediate files)
  - reproducible (from sharing intermediate results and having the same starting point)
  - Idempotent (should always get the same output for a given an input)
- Makefile
  - to solve dependencies & compose targets
  - automatic invalidation
  - proven technology
  - still state of the art

```sh
## Format of make target
output: inputs
  command

## Example
rdata/crawl.rda: crawl.R
  R --vanilla --slave --file=crawl.R
```

- Pure functions
  - can only depend on the input you give it
  - inputs need to be explicit, but "side-effect" talks to web service (output not reproducible)
  - Pure functions cannot have side effects, state mutation, and output must be directly from input
  - with pure functions, you are able to do testing
- Defensive programming to make assertions (`stopifnot`, `assertthat` for R)

## Javascript for numeric computing

> [Math, Numeric Computing, and JavaScript](https://csvconf.com/speakers/#athan-reines) -- Athan Reines\\
> <a href="https://twitter.com/kgryte" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false">Follow @kgryte</a><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you to everyone at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/csvconf?src=hash">#csvconf</a> who came to my talk about <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/math?src=hash">#math</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/javascript?src=hash">#javascript</a>!

**Why JS?**

- Language of the Web
- Numeric computing is not typically thought to be done with Javascript
- JS is dynamically compiled and faster than R and python
- Community of numerical computing in JS is small
- Lack of JS Libraries (such as numpy in Python) for numerical analysis
- You might want to leverage JS because:
  - Web APIs
  - Rendering
  - Visualization/computation
  - Ubiquity
  - Distribution (only need URL in browser)
  - Package management
- Applications you can do
  - Edge computing (outsource computing to client's machine)
  - Cross-platform
  - Compute Intensive
  - Interactive Data Analysis
  - Integrated machine learning in web browser context
  - AI powered

**State of Math in JS** is not that great

- No standard algorithms
- No min precision
- portability
- No common codebase
- Slow pace of innovation
- Bugs

**State of Ecosystem** is also not that great

- False assumptions
- Poor implementations (how do they compute variability?)
- Inefficient scope
- Lack of ambition

**Standard library ([stdlib](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib))**

- A standard library for JavaScript and Node.js with emphasis of numerical computing
- yes REPL help document
- Still in active development; your help is needed


- ["Web Assemblies"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly) is a is an efficient low-level bytecode format for in-browser client-side scripting
- Javascript is asynchronous
