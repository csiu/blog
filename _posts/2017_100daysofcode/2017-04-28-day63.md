Yesterday I was having a difficult time with the Kaggle kernel. Today, I explored the [Sberbank](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sberbank-russian-housing-market) dataset locally using my normal setup.

The R Markdown document of this little project can be found [here](https://github.com/csiu/kaggle/blob/master/sberbank/src/day63.Rmd) (and the Markdown version is [here](https://github.com/csiu/kaggle/blob/master/sberbank/src/day63.md)).

### Data size

The training data has 30,471 samples and 292 columns. The 292 columns refer to 1 ID column, 290 feature columns, and 1 `price_doc` output column that the competition is trying to predict.

### How complete is the data?

When working with data, ideally it would be complete and not missing any values. In the dataset, 17% of columns contain missing data in at least 1 sample. Here we show the proportion of missing data per feature with missing data.

### What columns are there?

290 is a lot of features, I next wonder what they are by grouping them by the feature label. I come up with the following categories of features:

- Features involving whether the individual is male or female
- Features involving the distance to places of interest such as schools or churches
- Features involving average prices
- Features that contain "raion" in label (I don't know what that is)
- Features that are count data
- Features that contain "part" in label
- Features that contain "1line" in label
- Features that contain "sqm" in label
- and the remaining features which I label as "Other"

### Some of the Other features: floor space

I also wanted to take a closer look at `full_sq` and `life_sq`. In particular, I wanted to know what was the difference between the two.

From this plot, it seems like there are 2 outlier samples.

```
##      id full_sq life_sq price_doc  diff
##   <int>   <int>   <int>     <int> <int>
## 1  3530    5326      22   6868818  5304
## 2 13549      79    7478   7705000 -7399
```

When we consider the price of the property, it does not look like these 2 samples (with the greater floor space) are higher in price (which is counter intuitive because I would expect bigger properties cost more).

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/figure/2017-04-28/p_life.png" style="display: block; margin: auto; width:50%; float: right" />

Removing these outlier samples, we find that `full_sq` tends to be larger than `life_sq` by ~22 sq. When we consider the property price (per million), a number of properties around 200 `full_sq` are priced higher.

### Distance features

Another group of features I want to look at is distance to places of interest. Running a correlation on these features, we find that water, green, industrial, cemetery, and big roads seem to be far from everything else.
